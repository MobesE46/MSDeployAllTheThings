# MSDeploy All the Things

This is a set of build and deployment tasks which utilize or support MSDeploy.

## We LOVE MSDeploy!!!

MSDeploy has proven itself extremely useful for our deployment needs in the past and we believe it has value going forward.  Check out [my blog](https://dotnetcatch.com) for all the ways you can use it.

## Tasks

We include a single task today MSDeployPackageSync:

> This task is used to deploy a MSDeploy package to a configured destination. This task is fairly generic allowing the users to set advanced MSDeploy options/arguments.
